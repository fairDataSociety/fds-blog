Attention privacy activists, data enthusiasts and supporters of a free and open internet! We have some exciting news to share with you.

**On March 21st 2023, Fair Data Society will be marking a NEW DAY,  
**_(a new dawn),_  
_(a new life),  
_**as it is about to graduate from Swarm, and we are - _feeling good_!**

After being incubated by Swarm Foundation since 2020, Fair Data Society is about to step on its independent path. This virtual event is a celebration of our journey so far and a glimpse into our future towards the decentralised self-sovereign data commons. We invite you to attend our event and join us in the quest for a free digital world!

The event is online, so you can join us from anywhere in the world.

To quote the legendary Tim Berners-Lee: _“Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.”_ That’s why it is crucial to preserve as much data and make it as available to the public as possible. The Great Data Upload aims to do just that. How? More will be revealed at the event, along with hands-on demos and a lively conversation. Join us **on the 21 March at 17.00 CET**.

_Taking back ownership of data is hard. But not impossible._

We’re looking forward to making it possible with you!
