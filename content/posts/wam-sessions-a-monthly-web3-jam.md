+++
On **9 August 2022** **at 17:00 CET,** **Fair Data Society** will kick off its series of Web3-themed talks called **WAM Sessions**, hosted on the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.com/channels/888359049551310869/940634835339317259) and Twitter spaces (links will be provided in advance).

These **informative and thought-provoking discussions** will focus on **privacy, digital freedom and the arts at the intersection of Web3**. The discussions will be complemented with practical **video workshops** that will show you how Web3 technologies can make your life more private and decentralised.

With WAM Sessions you’ll get to look past the marketing hype and be able to understand why Web3 is not just a fad, but a technology with deep inherent value and potential.

Every month, two new sessions with complementary workshops will air. In addition to the discussions, you’ll have the opportunity to dive into a live debate with the guests after each session on the [Fair Data Society Discord](https://discord.com/channels/888359049551310869/940634835339317259) (“stage-chat” channel).
