It has become almost a tradition now that we release new features (or products) at important conferences. We think this is a good way to bring the news out to the people and at the same time, it forces us to commit to a certain pace of work.

This year was no different. [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) (3C) in Leipzig is an important milestone for us and the dates of the congress are perfect to wrap up the year and end it with a sweet, final release.

**What is C3? And why does it matter?**

\[Wikipedia:\] The C3 is an annual conference organized by the [Chaos Computer Club](https://www.ccc.de/en). The congress features a variety of lectures and workshops on technical and political issues related to security, cryptography, privacy and online [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech). The event takes place regularly at the end of the year since 1984, with the current date and duration (27–30 December) established in 2005. It is considered one of the largest events of this kind, alongside the [DEF CON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON) in Las Vegas.

An important part of the congress are the _assemblies_, semi-open spaces with clusters of tables and internet connections for groups and individuals to collaborate and socialize in projects, workshops and hands-on talks. These assembly spaces, introduced at the 2012 meeting, combine the hack center project space and distributed group spaces of former years.

**The Critical Decentralization Cluster is the crypto place to be at CCC**

“[Critical Decentralization Cluster (CDC)](https://decentral.community/)”, organized by [RIAT](https://riat.at/) and the [Monero community](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroCommunity/) has become CCC’s main meeting point and knowledge center for topics related to blockchain and decentralization. It is growing bigger every year and this was the first time they were included in the official media-streaming next to CCC’s main content of all their stages, which naturally resulted in a visible increase in popularity. We are proud of our friends at RIAT because they are working hard to organize this cluster and they are doing a really great job. See all CDC talks recorded on video [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Critical+Decentralisation+Cluster).

**Previewing Fairdrop’s new feature “honest inbox” live demo was blessed by the “demo gods”**

CDC had a really nice line up of speakers who presented their projects in 15 min slots. There was **Scott Beibin** with his brilliant new idea called MandelBotHAB, **Alexis Roussel** had an important speech on how constitutions should change to prevent data slavery; there was **Deanna MacDonald** who spoke about privacy-related issues; **Harry Halpin** announced some big promises for the [Nym project](https://nymtech.net/) this year. **Viktor Tron **was not present at the conference, but had a live video conference presentation on [Swarm](https://swarm.ethereum.org/).

We had a speech too. Gregor Žavcer talked about the [Fair Data Society](https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5c34b2e746d9c67925654070). He presented the organization in his own, unique way, with a ton of positive energy. The crowd learned what the Fair Data Society is and got a short update on the work that has been done since last year.

The peak of the talk was our live demo of a just 10minute-old release (please say nothing) that was tested for the first time live at 36C3. Despite Gregor’s sweaty hands, the tremble in his voice and the unstable internet connection, he had the guts to test the new release in front of all the people and the cameras transmitting his talk live over the internet. We all prayed with him that it would all go OK, but the gods of live demos favor the brave and the demo went just fine.

**We did a nice little guerilla action and hung some posters in the hallways of the congress**

**So, what the heck is an honest inbox?**

If you took the time to watch the video above, then you probably have an idea of the many ways this can be used. If not, just know that it is a “whistleblower-friendly”, completely private file transfer option that can have many different applications and we discuss all this in more detail in a separate [blog post here](https://medium.com/fair-data-society/honest-inbox-upgrade-of-fairdrop-xyz-b0240f2408e8).

In the meantime, reserve your inbox name at Fairdrop before some schmuck takes it away from you. [Visit Fairdrop here](https://fairdrop.xyz/).

**Conclusion**

All in all, 36C3 was a great experience. We learned a lot. We met some really nice new people. We released a new feature publicly. We had some awesome parties. And you can bet your life we’ll come again.
