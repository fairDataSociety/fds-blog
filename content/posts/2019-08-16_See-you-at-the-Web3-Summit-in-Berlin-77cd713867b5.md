Hey, everyone. Form August 19–21 the Datafund team will be in Berlin, attending one of the key annual events in Web3 development, the Web3 Summit in Berlin. We’ll be there to see the latest developments in decentralised technologies and also make sure new crowds hear about the work we do.

We’re excited to see and talk to some of the great folks we’ve had the pleasure to meet over the years and make new acquaintances. If you’ll be in Berlin and want to meet up or talk to us, let us know through one of our channels listed below. We’d love to hear from you!

See you in Berlin!+6
