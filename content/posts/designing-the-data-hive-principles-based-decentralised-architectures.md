**Introduction**

Decentralised architectures and networks are slowly embedding themselves into the technological and societal landscape, empowered by communities of like-minded people who strive to alter the existing socio-economic order by leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies that afford disintermediation and radical shifts in how entities maintain trust. Bottom-up initiatives, free from centralised control and command structures, are appearing cross-sectorally - built on the premise, and promise, of distributed ledger technology.

In this article, we discuss one such initiative, Swarm, by drawing relations between its developed set of community-centred, bottom-up Fair Data Principles and the incumbent, top-down, principles-based frameworks that govern today’s existing data-sharing economy, with a focus on data protection.

We also introduce the idea of the commons along with a set of “commons design principles”. We highlight how the Swarm community might simultaneously implement principles flowing from existing data protection frameworks and the commons to guide the development of robust design strategies to manifest the communicated goal of a fair and just data-led society.

**What is Swarm**

Swarm is a P2P, decentralised storage and communication infrastructure, compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. The Swarm mission is to provide the technical platform for a decentralised internet - based on a normative framework that is aligned with the Fair Data Principles and envisioned as a vehicle for a fairer society.

The Swarm ecosystem describes a fair data economy as an “Economy of processing data characterised by fair compensation of all parties involved in its creation or enrichment”. This ideological foundation is viewed as a cornerstone of a better society and the bedrock of how individuals might wrestle back control from the overreach of corporations and government; the platform attempts to shift the control of data processing away from large, centralised entities and into the hands of individuals in a just, fair and equitable manner.

The key to achieving the ideal is detailed in the Swarm whitepaper. The overarching vision is born through the deployment of the technology stack, designed to act as a medium through which the Swarm network optimises network bandwidth and storage resources (hard disk memory). It consists of a P2P network of nodes that communicate according to an agreed distributed consensus mechanism and leveraged by an in-built incentivisation scheme.

The technology stack, in practice, is a series of technologies that act in concert and comprises four distinct layers:
