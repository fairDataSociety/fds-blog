**Introduction**

Decentralised architectures and networks are slowly embedding themselves into the technological and societal landscape, empowered by communities of like-minded people who strive to alter the existing socio-economic order by leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies that afford disintermediation and radical shifts in how entities maintain trust. Bottom-up initiatives, free from centralised control and command structures, are appearing cross-sectorally - built on the premise, and promise, of distributed ledger technology.

In this article, we discuss one such initiative, Swarm, by drawing relations between its developed set of community-centred, bottom-up Fair Data Principles and the incumbent, top-down, principles-based frameworks that govern today’s existing data-sharing economy, with a focus on data protection.

We also introduce the idea of the commons along with a set of “commons design principles”. We highlight how the Swarm community might simultaneously implement principles flowing from existing data protection frameworks and the commons to guide the development of robust design strategies to manifest the communicated goal of a fair and just data-led society.

**What is Swarm**

Swarm is a P2P, decentralised storage and communication infrastructure, compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks. The Swarm mission is to provide the technical platform for a decentralised internet - based on a normative framework that is aligned with the Fair Data Principles and envisioned as a vehicle for a fairer society.

The Swarm ecosystem describes a fair data economy as an “Economy of processing data characterised by fair compensation of all parties involved in its creation or enrichment”. This ideological foundation is viewed as a cornerstone of a better society and the bedrock of how individuals might wrestle back control from the overreach of corporations and government; the platform attempts to shift the control of data processing away from large, centralised entities and into the hands of individuals in a just, fair and equitable manner.

The key to achieving the ideal is detailed in the Swarm whitepaper. The overarching vision is born through the deployment of the technology stack, designed to act as a medium through which the Swarm network optimises network bandwidth and storage resources (hard disk memory). It consists of a P2P network of nodes that communicate according to an agreed distributed consensus mechanism and leveraged by an in-built incentivisation scheme.

The technology stack, in practice, is a series of technologies that act in concert and comprises four distinct layers:

The technology itself should be viewed as the manifestation of an ideology that lies at the centre of the Swarm project. In order to achieve a fair data economy, a decentralised and permissionless data sharing infrastructure is required that allows participants to engage in data storage, sharing and processing with economic benefit accruing to those who created the data, or are the data rights holders. This approach is a shift away from the economic hegemony of the existing data economy - where large, powerful data collectors, processors and sub-processors extract most of the revenue, with very little benefit accruing to those who generated the data, or own the rights.

Swarm is not the first incarnation of a blockchain-based decentralised storage infrastructure, with notable projects such as Sia, Filecoin, and Storj also deployed into the market. Distributed content storage also has a rich history, developing alongside distributed file systems such as the open source project, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). What sets Swarm apart is the explicit commitment to a defined set of open data principles, along with a commitment to building a fair data economy.

While other systems have their own native tokens as vehicles for data sharing, resource allocation and security, Swarm proposes the BZZ token as the transactory foundation through which entities engage in a “collective information” community - moving the value of data, and associated meta-data, into the hands of the data creators.

As previously mentioned, Swarm also proposes a set of core principles - viewed as an integral step in realising a shared social contract for the Swarm community. The social contract acts as a normative framework that should guide behaviours and actions in the data economy, essentially a principles-based ideology to which all participants in the network adhere - in theory. In practice, however, it is not as clearly defined.

Swarm’s overarching vision is based on a core set of “meta-values”:

• **Inclusivity** - public and permissionless participation.

• **Integrity** - privacy, provable provenance.

• **Incentivisation** - alignment of interest of node and network.

• **Impartiality** - content and value neutrality.

The Swarm project describes these meta-values as systemic qualities, shared throughout the network. This bottom-up, inclusive ideology is key to understanding the potential impact of their P2P data economy, as it shifts emphasis away from authority and hierarchy towards concepts such as collective responsibility, common ideology and principles-based governance.

Principles-based data sharing ideologies have a rich history, originating in a number of data protection frameworks around the world. Applying a principles-based framework to a P2P network is, however, a novel and unique strategy. It could be stated that Swarm is attempting to build a bottom-up data economy, based on emergent, permissionless, and non-hierarchical principles. This contrasts strongly with the top-down approaches that have, more often than not, emerged from centralised regulatory or legislative bodies.

**Introduction to principles-based data protection frameworks**

The emergence of digital technologies has brought monumental change in how society functions, whether seen through the lens of computation, telecommunications, or the concept of the internet and all its related technologies. Central to most conceptions of modern society is the collection, exchange and storing of digital information or data. Since the 1970s, data protection regulation has been developing globally in an effort to protect data and the privacy of its owners, as well as to provide the structure to ensure the free flow of data for economic purposes.

**_A top-down approach: international, supranational and national regulation_**

Various top-down regulatory and legal frameworks guide local and global data flows. The US Federal Trade Commission, an independent governmental agency tasked with protecting consumers and maintaining competition, released the US Fair Information Practices or FIPs in 1973 (since updated and now called Fair Information Practice Principles). The goal was to outline a set of principles to help maintain informational privacy in an electronic marketplace. The FIPs represented the first attempt by a governmental body to regulate the data market - and laid out a framework to support the functioning of the emerging data economy. Several European states, such as Sweden and Germany, subsequently enacted their own data protection laws.

At a supranational level, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data in 1980. This principles-based framework attempted to provide a more internationally-accepted instrument to guide the now established (and rapidly developing) data economy. Almost concurrently, the Council of Europe issued the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) in 1981

National constitutional traditions and, eventually, the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive and its 2016 replacement the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), further regulated personal data flows. The notion of personal data protection became increasingly focused on individuals and framed through a rights-based approach.

In 2020, the European Commission issued their proposal for an EU Data Governance Act, which applies to both personal data and non-personal data. This proposed legislation demonstrates how the EU Commission could be becoming more conscious of a commons-/fairness-based approach to data flows and has commonalities with the bottom-up approaches that we see emerging within decentralised networks and their associated technological architectures.

**_A bottom-up approach: the decentralised model_**

Much of the distributed ledger based technologies that have emerged over the last 10 years is rooted in a specific philosophical ideology, intended to replace or reject statist ideals with more democratic, equal, libertarian or anarchic models of social organisation. For a shared social contract to emerge within a community, a shared set of ideals must manifest through the community. Most distributed ledger-based incarnations root ideology within a network “whitepaper” or GitHub repository, often enveloped as community or network “ground-zero”.

Swarm propose the Fair Data Society’s Fair Data Principles as the bedrock of a shared social contract, intended to inform the ideology and philosophy of all Swarm network participants. Not only do the principles support the existing ‘Book of Swarm’, they set out (and maintain) various principles to which behaviours and actions of agents in the social layer of the network should adhere. While the principles should not be seen as a defined set of rules, they do look and feel extremely similar to data protection principles we have seen develop from the top-down approaches. By examining the principles side by side, we can draw out common themes - highlighting how both sets of principles have common overarching ideals - even though they have developed in very different ways.
