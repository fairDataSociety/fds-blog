## “HI, tell me everything”

Today, we are announcing a new feature of [Fairdrop](https://fairdrop.xyz/), that we nicknamed “Honest inbox”. We see it as a radical honesty approach that doesn’t necessarily ruin relationships.

For those who just joined in, [Fairdrop.xyz](https://fairdrop.xyz/) is a free, decentralised, private and secure file transfer zero-data dapp. It is based entirely on [Fair Data Society principles](https://principles.fairdatasociety.org) and runs on [Swarm](https://swarm.ethereum.org/), [decentralised storage](https://swarm.ethereum.org/). For more info about Fairdrop, check out this [blog post](https://medium.com/fair-data-society/fairdrop-secure-private-unstoppable-file-transfer-for-the-free-world-7200f948bb32).

## **Receive honest feedback into your honest inbox**

Honest inbox, wtf? What does this really mean? If we describe it as a feature, it means that every Fairdrop user can also have auto-generated personalised URL, where files can be dropped for that user e.g. drop us a file at [fairdrop.xyz/datafund](https://fairdrop.xyz/datafund)

In terms of usability, the fastest explanation will be through a couple of user stories:

* A journalist provides their address to their informants which can send the files without being linked back to them

* A CEO shares honest inbox address with their employees in order to receive anonymous and honest feedback

* A traveler doesn’t want to give out their email address but shows just a QR code where files can be dropped for him

* Organisations can setup their honest inbox to receive feedback

* Introduce radical honesty into personal relationships without ruining the relationship — friends can tell you things you need to hear without stress.

## Honest inbox is where you can receive files without surveillance, censorship or meta trails because the sender stays anonymous
>  *With honest inbox, we are filling the gap in Fairdrop’s user scenarios, enabling anybody — individuals, organisation, journalists — to easily setup (or self-host) their site for anonymously receiving files or feedback. Honest inbox is democratising whistleblowing and bringing it to everybody.*

**Scenarios covered by Fairdrop now are:**
1. **Quick send** — drop a file, click upload and get back a link for sharing. No account needed.
2. **Honest inbox** — visit custom link e.g. fairdrop.xyz/john, drop a file and click upload. No account needed for the sender. The file is encrypted with the recipient’s public key.
3. **1–1 Encrypted send** — both, sender and receives need an account while exchanged data is encrypted with a shared secret

## Do you dare to have an honest inbox?

Go ahead, [register your inbox at Fairdop.xyz and claim your name](https://fairdrop.xyz/) while it is still available.
