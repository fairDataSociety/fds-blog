+++
We are happy to announce a new Fairdrop feature that’s been requested by our users — one-click folder upload to Swarm. It literally can’t be easier, try it out!

> **Important disclaimer!** Swarm is in testnet and public content uploads are not pinned in Fairdrop, therefore persistence is not guaranteed. For guaranteed persistence, we advise dapp developers as the next step to start their own Swarm node and pin their content locally.
