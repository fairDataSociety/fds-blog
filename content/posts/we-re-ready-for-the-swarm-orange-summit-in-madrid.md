## Our whole team will be there

[Datafund hosted the last event](https://blog.datafund.net/the-swarm-is-here-swarm-orange-summit-in-ljubljana-b9eeb292d175) and this year its whole team is heading off to Spain to see what the [Swarm](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/) community has been up to in the past year.

As current Fair Data Society’s core code contributors Datafund’s team will be presenting what they have been working on in recent months. Three speakers have prepared talks for the event: Datafund’s CTO, **Tadej Fius**, and the two senior coders, **Dan Nickless & Zahoor Mohamed**. The focus of their talks will be largely on how to scale and expand decentralized file exchange through Swarm.

## Multibox, setting up Fairdrop & sending 100 GBs over Swarm

First up will be Tadej with his presentation of multibox, the decentralized group file-sharing functionality based on [Fairdrop’s](http://fairdrop.xyz) file exchange system. Dan will demonstrate to the audience how to set up their own file-sharing dapp with the help of the fds.js library. And finally, Zahoor will present how he went about sending 100 GB files over the Swarm network with the accompanying pitfalls and solutions. There will also be five-minute Q&A sessions after each talk and we expect some lively debates.

We’ll be following the event and will post all the highlights and summaries of talks, as well as uploading all the videos relating to the talks on Fair Data Society’s tech to our Youtube channel after the summit, so keep following us to stay up to date.
